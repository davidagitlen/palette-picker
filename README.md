# Color Schema

Color Schema is a color palette picking web app built for web developers. It is a paired project built during Mod 4 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software and Design.

Color Schema challenges front end students to build and deploy development, testing and [production](https://palette-picker-api-williams.herokuapp.com) environments for a one-to-many relational database with two tables and eleven endpoints. Students then build, test and deploy a [React front end](https://palette-picker-dg.herokuapp.com) to fetch, display, and update their color projects and palettes to the end user.

Our user, a web developer, can create and save a named palette of five hex codes in relation to their named project. Multiple palettes can be assigned to one project. Existing projects and palettes can also be selected, edited, and updated in the database. All palettes begin with randomized hex codes; the user can 'lock' one or more colors, then generate new random colors until their palette is complete.

Color Schema was inspired by schema diagrams that visualize database design, such as dbdiagram.io.

Color Schema was built with React, Jest, Enzyme, CORS middleware, Postman, Travis CI, Heroku, Flaticon.com, Adobe Xd and Adobe Illustrator.
